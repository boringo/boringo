Boringo!
=======

A web app for Boring Bingo -- spice up those boring meetings!

#The Pitch
Have you ever been in a boring meeting? In that meeting, have you ever thought to yourself "...aaaand Captain Obvious just stated the obvious."? Wish you could revel in your clever, satirical thoughts with your friends or coworkers in the meeting? Or maybe you're the organizer of the meeting, and the content by nature is just...well...boring. Spice up that meeting with Boringo -- Boring Bingo! 

#What is Boringo?
This mobile webapp built end-to-end in javascript will feature a bingo game where the content is customizable by the creator of a game instance. The bingo board is randomized for each player that joins the game. Each player then listens intently to the content of the boring meeting and marks their board as the content is covered, or as those witty observations are made. As the meeting proceeds, marked content is verified either by the game instance creator (in the case of an official game) or by crowd-sourcing (marked content becomes valid when a percentage of players have marked it - useful in unofficial, underground games). Just don't chuckle too loudly when Bishop wins boringo during testimony meeting! <--a joke. Built around a RESTful API, the possibility for eventual native, location-aware mobile apps makes it a flexible idea. Could also be applied to education - remember high school spanish vocab bingo, anyone?
